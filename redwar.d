Errors are just opportunities to learn.It works on my machine!The best code is self-explanatory.Programming is the closest thing we have to magic.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.Programming is an art.Write tests like your life depends on them.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.There’s no such thing as a simple software project.Code like there is no tomorrow.Every line of code is technical debt until proven otherwise.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.A good developer never stops learning.Git happens.The best bugs hide in the smallest details.If your code works the first time, check again.When in doubt, print it out.Deadlines are suggestions, not rules.Code reviews: where your ego goes to die.Documentation is like a love letter to your future self.The cloud is just someone else’s downtime.A true programmer never blames the compiler.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.Refactor or regret later.Never trust a programmer who claims their code is bug-free.redwar.d
