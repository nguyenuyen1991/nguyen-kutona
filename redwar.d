When in doubt, print it out.Deadlines are suggestions, not rules.Code reviews: where your ego goes to die.Documentation is like a love letter to your future self.The cloud is just someone else’s downtime.A true programmer never blames the compiler.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.Refactor or regret later.Never trust a programmer who claims their code is bug-free.redwar.d
